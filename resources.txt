chapters?

text formatting for character names?!

getting started on stop words

use range over time - add to d3 as data is parsed

sanitize data personally for [illustration] etc or smart analysis?

split by sentence at first?

match case of story as it is read

special keyword map for proper, frequently occuring values

weird word entries
	meanstomakeanythingprettier


// specific data structure in map?
challenges
	displaying properly for so much data
	formatting - hyphens to next row or hypens for multi-word

ideas
	colors for articles, etc
	look up part of speech (noun, verb, etc)
	put most heavily connected nodes into the center

directions
	gradient
	explore by chapter
	highlight chapter on top of blob

limit neighbors to topX neighbors or limit to top 1 word and recenter
create a config file/object to init
	top X values		--> adjust with sliders
	top X neighbors


when clicking on neighbors
sliders to adjust settings, with preset options
use top 3 words (as connections)
	use color values to show intersection
call fx.apply in TopWords

value updates

trouble
	updating graph values
	creating tooltip
	hover event not firing -- is linked but not resource

firing: directionality --> http://bl.ocks.org/d3noob/5141278
